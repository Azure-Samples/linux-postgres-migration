# Our workload 

Our workload is a cloud agnostic application written in Go and/or Python that works with data inside of PostgreSQL. 

Our data is an open dataset that will enable you to explore the power of our Postgres platform and related extensions. 

Thought this application could easily be run within a container, the stakeholders have not chosen to do so at this stage. So building a container, and deploying to a container platform, or using container orchestration, are out of scope at this stage, but this may be a logical future step. 

The application, and its associated data, has been provided for you in the GitHub repository associated with this Learning Path. You will understand how to prepare your application and export your data to reach a similar state to this sample application, or even use it as a template for a green-field deployment.
